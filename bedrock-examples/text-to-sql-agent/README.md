# Text-to-SQL agent

A powerful AWS Bedrock agent that converts natural language queries into SQL and executes them against an enterprise financial database. This agent demonstrates how to build intelligent database querying assistants using AWS Bedrock's agent capabilities with WRITER's Palmyra models.

## Overview

This agent allows users to ask questions about enterprise financial data in natural language, such as:
- "What customer has the highest transaction amount?"
- "Show me the top 10 customers by total spending"
- "Which employees made the most sales?"

The agent automatically:
1. Fetches the database schema
2. Converts your question into SQL
3. Executes the query against the database
4. Returns formatted results

### Architecture

The project consists of several AWS services working together:

- **AWS Bedrock Agent**: The main AI agent that handles natural language processing
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes SQL queries against the database
- **Amazon Athena**: Query engine for the enterprise financial database
- **AWS Glue**: Data catalog and crawler for the enterprise financial dataset
- **Amazon S3**: Stores the database schema and query results
- **IAM**: Manages permissions and roles

## Prerequisites

Before running these examples, ensure you have:

### 1. AWS account & Bedrock access
- **AWS Account** with access to Amazon Bedrock

### 2. Python environment
- **Python 3.10+** installed
- **boto3** SDK for Python: `pip install boto3`

## Installation & setup

### Subscribe to Bedrock models
Palmyra X5 and X4 models are available in the **US West (Oregon)** AWS Region with cross-Region inference.

1. Go to the [AWS Bedrock Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
2. Navigate to "Model access"
3. Request access to the Writer models you want to use:
   - `writer.palmyra-x5-v1:0`
   - `writer.palmyra-x4-v1:0`

### List available models
Verify your access to Palmyra models:
```bash
aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region=us-west-2 --by-provider writer --query "modelSummaries[*].modelId"
```

### Environment configuration
If you haven't already, copy the `.env.template` file to a `.env` file in the project root with your AWS credentials:
```
cp .env.template .env
```
**Note:** You only need to fill in the below credentials for these examples.

```
# AWS Credentials
AWS_REGION_NAME=your AWS region
AWS_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=Bedrock model ID you want to use
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your AWS access key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your AWS secret key
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your AWS session token
```

### Running `/text-to-sql`

#### 1. Initialize the environment

   Run the initialization script to create all required AWS resources:

   ```bash
   python utils/initialize_environment.py
   ```

   This script will:
   - Create an S3 bucket for storing data and results
   - Set up AWS Glue database and crawler for the enterprise financial dataset
   - Create Lambda function for executing SQL queries
   - Create IAM roles and policies with appropriate permissions
   - Create the Bedrock agent with the specified foundation model
   - Set up action groups for database operations
   - Create an agent alias for deployment

**Note**: The initialization process may take 5-10 minutes as it creates multiple AWS resources and waits for them to be ready.

#### 2. Run the Agent

   Once initialization is complete, you can start using the agent:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Interactive mode

The agent runs in interactive mode by default. Simply type your questions:

```
ðŸ§  Text to SQL Agent ðŸ§ 

Options:
  'exit' - Exit the program

> what customer has the highest transaction amount?
Calling LLM...
Trying to call /getschema...
Trying to call /querydatabase...
Final response were generated!

The customer with the highest transaction amount is Connie Henderson, with a transaction amount of $499.86.

SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, t.amount 
FROM customer_data c 
JOIN transaction_data t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id 
ORDER BY t.amount DESC 
LIMIT 1;

Query Results:
- First Name: Connie
- Last Name: Henderson
- Highest Transaction Amount: $499.86

> exit
Goodbye! ðŸ‘‹
```

### Example queries

Try these example queries to test the agent:

- "Show me the top 5 customers by total spending"
- "Which employees made the most sales?"
- "What are the highest transaction amounts by payment method?"
- "Show me customers who made multiple transactions"
- "What's the average transaction amount by product category?"

## Agent features

### Trace mode
The agent includes a trace mode that exposes the agent's "thinking" process in the console. Users can see the complete process of response creation, not just the final answer. This includes:
- LLM calls and responses
- Tool invocations (like `/getschema` and `/querydatabase`)
- Step-by-step reasoning

To enable/disable trace mode, modify the `enableTrace` parameter in the [`invoke_agent()` function call](main.py#L13) in `main.py`:

```python
agent_response = bedrock_agent_runtime_client.invoke_agent(
    inputText=query,
    agentId=agent_id,
    agentAliasId=agent_alias_id,
    sessionId=str(uuid.uuid4()),
    enableTrace=True,  # Set to False to disable trace mode
)
```

## Database schema

The agent works with an enterprise financial database containing the following tables:

- **customer_data**: Customer information (ID, name, contact details, etc.)
- **transaction_data**: Transaction records with amounts, dates, and payment methods
- **product_data**: Product catalog with categories and pricing
- **sales_data**: Sales records linking transactions to employees
- **employee_data**: Employee information with job titles and departments

**Note:** The enterprise financial database is located in the `\resources` folder

## Cleanup

To remove all created resources:

```bash
python utils/clean.py
```

This will delete:
- The Bedrock agent and alias
- Lambda function
- S3 bucket and contents
- IAM roles and policies
- Glue database and crawler
