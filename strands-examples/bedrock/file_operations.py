# 📁 File Operations Strands Agent

A specialized Strands agent focused on file operations.

## What This Example Shows

This example demonstrates:
- Creating a specialized Strands agent with selected tools
- Setting a custom system prompt for file operations
- Reading files with various modes and options
- Writing and modifying files through Strands Agents
- Using the editor tool for more complex file operations

## Key Tools

- **file_read**: Read file contents with different modes
  - View entire files
  - View specific line ranges
  - Search for patterns
  - Get file statistics

- **file_write**: Create and modify files
  - Write text to files
  - Append to existing files

- **editor**: Advanced file modifications
  - View files with syntax highlighting
  - Make targeted modifications
  - Find and replace text
  - Insert text at specific locations

## Usage Examples

Simple file reading:
```
Read the first 10 lines of /etc/hosts
```

Creating files:
```
Create a new file called hello.txt with content "Hello, Strands!"
```

Searching files:
```
Find all occurrences of "import" in my_script.py
```

Advanced editing:
```
In my_script.py, replace all instances of "old_function" with "new_function"
```

## Tips for File Operations

- Always specify the full path for files to avoid confusion
- Use relative paths when appropriate for portability
- Check file existence before attempting to read or modify
- Handle file permissions appropriately
